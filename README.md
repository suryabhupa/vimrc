# vimrc

Personal basic ~/.vim setup. Mainly features the following:

* [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)
* [Undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree)
* [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
* [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) color scheme 

Installed using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). The .vimrc is included but is somewhat messy -- excuse our appearance.
